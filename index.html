        <div>
            <p>I am currently a solutions developer and team lead for a company that specializes in a no-code platform to deliver mobile solutions to enterprise asset management software.</p>
            <div class="text-divider"></div>
            <p>I have spent the last four years working as a software developer and team lead.  I was hired at my current company in May 2021 and was promoted to Dev Team Lead in August of that year.  My ability and desire to help the others that I was hired along with made me really stand out.  Over the past few years the direction of the company has changed and my role has shifted into more of a solutions developer that provides customers with support of the platform that we provide.</p>
            <p>In February of 2025, I decided to partner with a friend to try and develop InvoiceWays, a project expenses tracking app that has invoicing capabilities where users can track customer estimates, invoices and accounts.  We both wanted to explore other avenues in development and really gain a grasp of the whole idea of starting and creating an app from start to deployment to try and generate revenue.  I always like creating a building, it's something I really enjoy.</p>
            <p>Between the full time job and working on InvoiceWays I stay pretty busy but I am always looking for new information to learn. With the increasing benefit that AI has begun to provide I have really started to utilize it as a tool to help me in my day to day when I get stuck or need to learn something quickly, which has really helped with my time efficiency.  I also understand the need to "fact-check" the results and validate the response.  Even with fact checking my productivity has really improved.</p>
            <p>Before I started my first job as a developer I had graduated from DigitalCrafts full-stack immersive development program.  I had always had an interest in web development and design and had done a lot of self learning on my own but the enrollment into the program allowed me to really connect and work with people who were interested in learning as well as people who I could learn from.  After I graduated the program I was able to become a Developer in Residence that allowed me to assist newer students as they worked their way through the program</p>
        <div class="text-divider"></div>
            <p> I just recently transitioned from
                my previous roll as an assistant warehouse manager. I spent 11+
                years managing and working with others for Ken Stanton Music, a
                chain of music stores in the Atlanta Metro area.</p>
                <div class="text-divider"></div>
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    Of course, I can't be a developer all the time so in my free time I am usually trying to find something to do.  I am a musician at heart and love to play guitar, maybe get a jam session or two together.  I really enjoy trying to find time to hang out with friends and family. I always love to just pick up a book and learn new things as well.  Try to stay busy but also try to take the breaks that are needed as well.

                documentation, I was able to create a customized
                theme to display the information and ideas that he
                wanted. I used some of the built-in functions from
                WordPress along with helper functions to display the
                blog posts.
